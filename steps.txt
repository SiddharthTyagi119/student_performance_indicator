the specific folder as a package.
3-Components- component will be created as a package-
data ingestion,transformation and model trainer.
4-Pipeline-
train_pipeline-To trigger components files
predict-to do prediction
5-Logger and exception -to do logging and exception handling
6-Utils- to write common things which will be used in the entire app
7- eda and model trainer ipynb file





steps-
write setup.py and maintain github then loggger and exception
download data and then proceed with eda file and model training just for observations.
create data_ingestion file that will create artifact folder that will hold train and test data
create data_transformation and in utils create a fn to save the preprocessor (preprocessing steps)
train the model  and in utils create a fn to save the pickle file of the model
perform hyperparameter tuning
create app.py --along with a template folder with home page and index page
create prediction pipeline
